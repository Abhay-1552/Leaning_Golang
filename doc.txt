Go programns are organized into packages.


1. To initialize the module before working

    go mod init <module/file name>

2. To run go files

    go run <file_name>

You need to tell Go compiler, the data types when declaring the new variable. But, Go can infer the type when you assign a value.

    var variableName = "Variable"

    or 

    var variableName string
    variableName = "Variable"

(for more check variable declaration folder)
